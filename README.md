GitHub Pages Boilerplate
------

A super simple, sparse boilerplate for setting up a front-end-only React site to be deployed on GitHub Pages.
Sass (scss) modules and Webpack bundling are in place. No database, no Redux.

### Start it up and develop it

* Change the name of the project (and the author if you're not me) in the package.json
* `$ npm start` and go to localhost:3003 in your browser to view the page

### Deploy it

* Follow the guide at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
    * The index.html is already in the root folder so you should just need to change your Pages settings for the repo.

###That's it!

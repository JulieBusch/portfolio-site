It allows a user to place a sensor with an accelerometer inside of something important to them that is kept in a shared space. The sensor wirelessly connects to a server running on the user’s computer. If the item is moved an alarm goes off on the computer and the user’s CLI prompts them to type a message to the thief; that message is then read aloud to the thief in the other room via text-to-speech conversion. Implemented Node server.'

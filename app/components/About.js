          Hello! I'm Julie Busch. Welcome to my site! It's in its infancy right now; as it progresses you can expect to see more media examples of my work. In the meantime, take a look around! There's still plenty to explore!
          <br />
          <br />
          I am a full stack software engineer with a background in stage management.
          <br />
          <br />

          The analytical skills of stage management have many parallels with coding. A stage manager translates the fantasy world of a play into the real world and is at the forefront of making an ephemeral work of art into a successful production. As a software engineer I am given an idea and then I do what needs to be done to bring that idea to fruition. I also happen to love the work that goes into making sense out of chaos. I'm proud of my ability to organize large amounts of information into documents that are useful, simple to understand, and visually appealing, and I strive to make clean, maintainable code that reflects that.
          <br />
          <br />
          My goal is to work full time as a developer for an energetic company in which I can grow. Given my past experience I think that product management would make the best use of my skills and would be highly fulfilling, but my current focus is on building software as an engineer. I enjoy working with the full stack and am particularly interested in front end development.

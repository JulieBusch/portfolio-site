          Hello! I'm Julie Busch. I am a full stack software engineer with a background in stage management.
          <br />
          <br />
          I was drawn to coding because it has many parallels with the organizational, analytical, and problem solving skills needed in stage management. A stage manager translates the fantasy world of a play into the real world and is at the forefront of making an ephemeral work of art into a successful production. As a software engineer I am given an idea and then I do what needs to be done to bring that idea to fruition. Both fields are highly collaborative, which is very appealing to me as well, and the communication skills and flexibility I possess have served me well in working on continually evolving projects that combine the technical and the creative. I also happen to love the work that goes into making sense out of chaos. One of my favorite things to do when working on a project is to transform large amounts of information into documents that are useful, simple to understand, and visually appealing, and I strive to make clean, maintainable code that reflects that.
          <br />
          <br />
          My goal is to work full time as a developer for an energetic company in which I can grow. A good developer never stops learning, and I am looking for a work environment that values collaboration and mentoring. I want to be able to continually challenge myself and develop my skills with the support of my colleagues. I value a company that encourages employees to express new ideas as well as questions and concerns, embraces equality and recognizes the benefits of a diverse workplace, and has a culture of friendliness and respect. I enjoy working with the full stack and am particularly interested in implementing visuals in the front end.
